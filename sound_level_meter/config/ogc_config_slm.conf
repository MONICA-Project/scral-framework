# IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
# start_slm.py script will use this config file to register OGC entities during SLM-GW integration phase.
# 
# During boot phase, predefined LOCATION, THING, SENSOR and PROPERTY entities will be registered.
# During integration phase, DATASTREAM and OBSERVATIONS will be generated dynamically.
# 
# DATASTREAM name is the concatenation of: THING-name + SENSOR-name + PROPERTY-name + deviceId.
# DATASTREAM name is now considered unique in the OGC-SYSTEM.
# Current logic allows unique identification of resources and prevents creation of duplicates.
#
# For more details, check
