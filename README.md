<!-- Short description of the project -->

The Smart City Resource Adaptation Layer (*SCRAL*) is a framework used in MONICA european project to manage several
different kinds of IoT devices.


## Getting Started
<!-- Instruction to make the project up and running. -->

SCRAL could be started as a Python 3 application but we suggest you to start using it downloading one of the *quickstart*
Docker containers that you can find on this [Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/monicaproject/scral).
SCRAL was tested mainly with Python 3.6 so it is suggested to install at least that version.

### How to use SCRAL
```

usage: SCRAL [-h] -p PILOT

arguments:
  -h, --help
        show this help message and exit
  -p PILOT, --pilot PILOT
        the name of the configuration folder

example: start_module.py -p MOVIDA  
```

Have a look to config folder to find more details about SCRAL configuration parameter.

### Examples
ex 1
```
./scral.py -h
```

## Deployment
<!-- Deployment/Installation instructions. If this is software library, change this section to "Usage" and give usage examples -->

To deploy a new SCRAL image, modify to your needs one of the dockerfile already contained in each module folder.

### Docker
To start using SCRAL is strongly suggest to take a Docker image *"as is"* and to configure properly the environmental variables. <br>
An update list of the configurable variable is available in the [Docker hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/monicaproject/scral).

## Development

### Prerequisite
SCRAL requires:
 - Python 3 (Python 3.6 or above suggested)
 - Frameworks:
    - [Flask](http://flask.palletsprojects.com)
    - [CherryPy](https://cherrypy.org/)
 - Python packages:
    - [Eclipse Paho](https://pypi.org/project/paho-mqtt/1.5) 1.5
    - [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/1.0.2) 1.1.1
    - [CherryPy](https://pypi.org/project/CherryPy/18.1.0) 18.5.0
    - [arrow](https://pypi.org/project/arrow/0.14.2) 0.14.2
    - [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/2.22) 2.22.0
    - [configparser](https://pypi.org/project/configparser/3.7.1) 3.7.1
 - Docker (to be containerized or to be used "as is")

#### Python packages
To install the required python3 packages:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Test
SCRAL does not have at the moment a test suite.<br>
Feel free to contribute if you want! :)

### Build
SCRAL is mainly written in Python 3 (that is an interpreted language) and so it could just be started without building anything.
